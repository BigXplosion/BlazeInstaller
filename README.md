BlazeLoader
===========

BlazeLoader is a minecraft mod loader and mod API designed for mods that change or disable vanilla behavior.  It will be lightweight, modifying as few base classes as possible.  It includes built in mod-loading that can load mods from zip or jar files with no extra resources!  Mods are detected by searching for classes that extend Mod and loading them independently.  This means multiple mods can exist in the same archive, and mods can be detected when installed into Minecraft directly!
